# 🧩 Keycloak Theme Examples

## 🛠️ Why this repo exists

When I first started customizing **Keycloak**, I quickly realized how *underdocumented* and scattered the theming system is.  
Sure — the docs mention `login`, `account`, `admin`, and `email` themes, but actual working examples? Not so much.

What followed was a long journey of trial and error, reverse engineering fragments, digging through outdated blog posts, and a good amount of headaches.  
Every single theme type had its own quirks — and getting something to just *look right* took way more effort than it should.

So, to save you the same trouble, I decided to collect everything I’ve learned into this repo.
